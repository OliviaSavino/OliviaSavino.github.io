    <strong>ABOUT ME:</strong>
    <p>I am a senior here at CU Boulder, studying Stratgic Communications with a minor in CTD. I am from Winnetka Illinois which is a suburb about 30 mins North of Chicago. I enjoy cooking/ baking, exercising, skiing and spending time with family and friends.</p>
    
    <strong>GOALS FOR THIS COURSE:</strong>
    <p>I would love to become more confident in my coding abilities. Unfortunately I am extremely intimidated by coding so I hope to gain better knowledge and truly absorb the information I am being taught this semester!</p>
